Here is the repository GitHub Link https://github.com/MaksimGorkii/test_logreg

Run the app locally: 
To run the server go to the server folder:
cd test_logreg && cd server && npm i && npm start

To run the app:
cd test_logreg && npm i && npm start

To run the data base run the db.sh file in the server folder
It is using “postgres” as a user with password “12345”.
It can be changed in .env and db.js in the server folder.
Heroku link is https://logreg1221.herokuapp.com/

It was a bigger challenge for me than I expected, but the app works as intended. 
Got a lot new knowledge about graphql, Prisma and Heroku so I am thankful no matter what your decision would be.
